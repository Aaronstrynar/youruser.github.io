    <body>
        The unordered list element is always paired with 
        list item elements as children. In unordered lists,
        list items have bullets in front of them by default.

        <ul>
            <li>List Item 1</li>
            <li>List Item 2</li>
            <li>List Item 3</li>
            <li>List Item 4</li>
            <li>List Item 5</li>
        </ul>

        Unordered lists have default margin and padding applied to them.
        They are frequently used to display information that has no
        particular order or sequence to it, such as product features
        or items in a navigation element.

        <p>
            An image element requires the source (src) attribute in order to display anything.
            Including the alternate (alt) attribute, which provides an alternate textual description
            of the image, is also good practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Image elements are inline elements, 

            <img src="images/cookbook.jpg" alt="ugly stained cookbook page">
            
            meaning they will appear "in line" with any text before and after it, 
            unless you alter their display properties or use line breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Images will also display at whatever their natural size is, so unless you've
            edited an image to be the exact size you want, you'll probably need to apply
            some CSS to resize your images.
        </p>
        <p>
            The image above is a "local" image, meaning its source comes from the same site 
            as the web page its loaded on, while the image below is a "web" image, meaning 
            its source comes from somewhere else on the internet.  Using "web" images is 
            little less work, but since you have no control over the image, it is not 
            recommended to use this approach; the example below is just there to show you 
            that you can.
        </p>

            src="https://www.bhg.com/thmb/c6LftxodTnftZ6NSeyT0DJDmkYg=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Vintage-Red-Plaid-BHG-Cookbook1-172a15c3b79643cca80a0cb26e90c1cf.jpg"

        <p>
            Note that image element code can be written on one line, but if it gets so long 
            that it goes offscreen in your text editor, it is better practice to separate 
            the element's attributes on separate lines.
